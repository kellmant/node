// Used to grab local vars for authkey, situation and cpstate

// accessed through <require assigned var>.myvar.[key] = value
//
// authkey: holds auth for api admin in these keys
// 	the entire smc config is pulled in and
// 	user (key=mgmt_admin_name), password (key=mgmt_admin_passwd)
// 	and hostname (key=hostname) are extracted.
// 	This data is sourced from the config_system
// 	used to build the R80 manager.
//
// situation: stores the event activity per session
// 	Can be any location, using session id from
// 	manager to track, but can be any identifier
// 	following a format of saving the event operation
// 	as the key, and the return data as the value.
// 	.uid/<operation> = return value
//
// cpstate: holds the active session id and token
// 	.uid is generated as an identifier
// 	.sid is required to authorize the session
// 	.url is the http call you will send post requests
// 	additional information is stored for debug if needed
